#### (written by GPT-4o)


Enjoy my Snake game for Android! 🎉 This project was created from **ChatGPT o1-preview** by 99%! 😊 

## 📱 About the Game

This Snake game brings the classic Snake fun to your Android device in a cool retro pixel art style. You control the snake simply by swiping in four directions:

- Swipe **up** ⬆️
- Swipe **down** ⬇️
- Swipe **right** ➡️
- Swipe **left** ⬅️

Collect points by eating apple on the screen, but watch out – don't crash into your own tail! Like in the classic Snake games, the snake grows longer with each bite, making the game more challenging as you go.

## 🏆 Features

- 🎨 **Pixel Art**: The graphics are designed in a lovingly crafted retro pixel art style.
- 🎮 **Simple Controls**: Intuitive controls – just swipe to steer the snake.
- 🏅 **Highscore System**: Challenge yourself and try to beat your own highscore! The top score is displayed in the main menu so you can always track your best performance.
- 🐍 **Retro Gaming Feel**: For all the nostalgics out there – this game brings the classic Snake vibe to your modern smartphone.
- 🎨 **Custom Icon**: The app icon was generated using DALL-E 3 and perfectly complements the retro look!
